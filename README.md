# Noted
A simple note taking app for short form note taking. A great no nonsense note taking app without any added distractions or fluff.
## Usage

Noted is very simple to use and almost self explanitory. 
- Give your note a name by clicking the 'Tittle'.
- Click the body text entitled 'New note...' to add to the current note.
- To add an additional note, click the blue '+' next to the last note and a new blank note will appear.
